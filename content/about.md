I'm Filipe Soares, a Software Developer from Brazil with over 10 years of experience, currently working at Jtech, a software development company of Veolia Group.

My career began in 2014, where I worked with Java, PostgreSQL, and various web technologies. Over the years, Iâ€™ve grown proficient in developing systems, improving performance, and solving complex problems using modern methodologies. I hold an MBA in Software Architecture and am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Applied Mathematics for computer science.

My focus areas of study include Microservices architecture, containerization with Docker, Kubernetes, and Web Security, as I constantly strive to improve my skills in technology. Outside of work, I enjoy eading books on technology, science and fiction.
